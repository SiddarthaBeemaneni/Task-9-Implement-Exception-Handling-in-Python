Scenario 3: Student Marks Processing

Write a Python program to calculate the average marks of 5 students. Handle exceptions if user enters non-numeric values or if marks are out of range (0-100).

Algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty list marks.

2. Repeat 5 times to input marks.

3. If input is non-numeric, raise exception "Invalid input."

4. If marks not in 0 to 100, raise exception "Marks should be between 0 and 100."

5. Else, append marks to the list.

6. Calculate average = sum(marks) / 5.

7. Display average.

    print("Error:", e)
Outp
ut:

Enter marks of student 1: 100

Enter marks of student 2: 98

Enter marks of student 3: 99

Enter marks of student 4: 50

Enter marks of student 5: 2

Average marks: 69.8

Result:

Thus, the Python program implementing exception handling is successfully completed and executed.
