Aim: To implement exception handling in Python programming.

Scenario 1: ATM Withdrawal System

Write a Python program to simulate an ATM withdrawal. If the user tries to withdraw more money than the balance, raise an exception and display an error.

Algorithm:

1. Initialize balance = 5000.

2. Input the withdrawal amount.

3. If amount > balance, raise exception "Insufficient balance!".

4. Else, deduct amount from balance and display success message and remaining balance.


Output:

Enter withdrawal amount: 5500

Error: Insufficient balance!
